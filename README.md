# OdnorsRPG
This is a simple text-based RPG game which I developed on my own for my College Java fundamentals course.

The RPG features a map which the user can travel through using basic commands such as up,down,left,right.
The user can find items which will help them to defeat the final boss: Odnor.

If the user decides to take on the boss directly, they will lose by a large margin.
The user is required to explore the map and obtain items to change the outcome of the fight.

The items the user can acquire affect their "attack" and "defense" stats.
One item they can get allows the user to hit the boss 3 times before he gets to attack.

There is also a shop feature, where users can spend their gold to increase their attack or defense.
